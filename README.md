# POS-StockControl
A restaurant POS with Stock Control coded in Python for A-Level Computer Science Coursework.

## Run Program
To run the program:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - python3 POS.py

## Documentation
As part of my coursework for A-Level I needed to document the journey of my program from creation to the final product and this can be found within the file named 'Project Report' in the repository. It includes documentation for the software development cycle including test cases that I created myself in order to check the program ran as per the requirements of the client.

Users with different roles (E.g Manager, Chef, Waiter etc) and their logins will be found in a file named 'Account Structure'. However the log in for the Manager is:
Username - WAhmed007
Password - password

## Note
This program was coded using Python 3.9 and PyQt5 but has now been updated to use PyQt6.
